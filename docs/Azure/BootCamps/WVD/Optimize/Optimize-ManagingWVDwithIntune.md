## Exercise 1 - Optional: Configure a custom domain name

> **NOTE: IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO SETUP A CUSTOM DOMAIN NAME TO COMPLETE THIS LAB.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS AND ACCEPT THAT YOU WILL BE GENERATING A REAL DOMAIN NAME AND ACCEPT THE ASSOCIATED FEES PLEASE CONTINUE WITH EXERCISE 1, OTHERWISE PROCEED TO EXERCISE 2.**

When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud-based service like Intune, you're given an initial domain name hosted in Azure Active Directory (AD) that looks like your-domain.onmicrosoft.com. In this example, your-domain is the domain name that you chose when you signed up. onmicrosoft.com is the suffix assigned to the accounts you add to your subscription. You can configure your organization's custom domain to access Intune instead of the domain name provided with your subscription.

Before you create user accounts or synchronize your on-premises Active Directory, we strongly recommend that you decide whether to use only the `.onmicrosoft.com` domain or to add one or more of your custom domain names. Set up a custom domain before adding users to simplify user management. Setting up a customer domain lets users sign in with the credentials they use to access other domain resources.

We will be using the  Azure App Service to buy a custom domain.  Your app's App Service plan must be a paid tier (Shared, Basic, Standard, or Premium). In this step, you make sure that the app is in the supported pricing tier.

### Create an App Service Plan

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub) to the Create Hub and search for and select **App Service Plan**, then click **Create**.
2. On the Basics tab complete the following: 
    * Resource Group: **WVDLab**
    * Name: WVDAppPlan
    * Operating System: Windows
    * Region: **Select the same region as your other WVD Resources**
    * Sku and size: Change to Shared D1
        * > This is the least expensive plan that supports custom domain names.
3. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.
4. Once created, click on **Go to resource**.

### Create an Web App

1. In the Azure Portal click on **+Create a resource**.
2. In the search bar type in and select **Web App** followed by **Create**.
3. On the Basics tab complete the following: 
    * Resource Group: **WVDLab**
    * Name: `<yourinitials>`WVD (e.g. abcWVD)
        > Ensure the domain name resolves in the .azurewebsites.net namspace.
    * Runtime stack: **>NET Core 3.1 (LTS)
    * Region: **Select the same region as your other WVD Resources**
    * Ensure your App Service Plan is selected.
4. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.
5. Once created, click on **Go to resource**.

### Buy the domain

1. In the App Services tab, under Settings, select Custom domains.
