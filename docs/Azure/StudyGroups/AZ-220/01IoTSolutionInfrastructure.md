# Determine Workload Requirements (10-15%)

This particular exam objective is very broad in nature, thus it is very difficult for us to list  materials to review that align to exam objectives in a 1:1 nature.

We recommend you read and become familiar with the following:

* [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/)
* [Azure Architecture Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/)
* [Develop a cloud adoption strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/)
* [Cloud Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) (Read all challenges)
* [Solution Ideas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/architectures/)

## Gather information and requirements

* identify compliance requirements
* identify identity and access management infrastructure
* identify service-oriented architectures
* identify accessibility requirements
* identify availability requirements
* identify capacity planning and scalability requirements
* identify deployability requirements
* identify configurability
* identify governance requirements
* identify maintainability requirements
* identify security requirements
* identify sizing requirements
* recommend changes during project execution
* evaluate products and services to align with solution
* create testing scenarios

## Optimize consumption strategy

* optimize app service costs
* optimize compute costs
* optimize identity costs
* optimize network costs
* optimize storage costs

## Design an auditing and monitoring strategy

* define logical groupings (tags) for resources to be monitored
* determine levels and storage locations for logs
* plan for integration with monitoring tools
* recommend appropriate monitoring tool(s) for a solution
* specify mechanism for event routing and escalation
* design auditing for compliance requirements
