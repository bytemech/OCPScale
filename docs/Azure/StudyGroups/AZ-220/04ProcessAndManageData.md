## Quick Reference: Key Concepts and Terminology
* Event Concepts:
  * *Events* - What happened
  * *Event sources* - Where the event took place
  * *Topics* - The endpoint where publishers send events
  * *Event subscriptions* - The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to more than one handler. Subscriptions are also used by handlers to intelligently filter incoming events
  * *Event handlers* - The app or service reacting to the event

* Key Features of Azure Event Grid:
  * *Simplicity* - Point and click to aim events from your Azure resource to any event handler or endpoint
  * *Advanced filtering* - Filter on event type or event publish path to make sure event handlers only receive relevant events
  * *Fan-out* - Subscribe several endpoints to the same event to send copies of the event to as many places as needed
  * *Reliability* - 24-hour retry with exponential backoff to make sure events are delivered
  * *Pay-per-event* - Pay only for the amount you use Event Grid
  * *High throughput* - Build high-volume workloads on Event Grid with support for millions of events per second
  * *Built-in Events* - Get up and running quickly with resource-defined built-in events
  * *Custom Events* - Use Event Grid route, filter, and reliably deliver custom events in your app

* Message Routing or Event Grid: How to Choose
  * What kind of data are you sending to the endpoints?
    * IoT Hub message routing to send telemetry data to other services
    * The IoT Hub integration with Event Grid works with events that occur in the IoT Hub service
  * What endpoints need to receive this information?
    * IoT Hub message routing supports limited number of unique endpoints and endpoint types, but you can build connectors to reroute the data and events to additional endpoints
    * The IoT Hub integration with Event Grid supports a larger variety of endpoint types
  * Does it matter if your data arrives in order?
    * IoT Hub message routing maintains the order in which messages are sent
    * Event Grid does not guarantee that endpoints will receive events in the same order that they occurred

* Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) Data Flow
  * A *job* consists of an input, query, and an output
  * *Input* – ASA can ingest data from Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, or Azure Blob Storage
  * *Query* – ASA uses a SQL-like query language that includes support for filtering, sorting, aggregating, joining, and user-defined functions
  * *Output* – ASA can output to many targets
  
* ASA input types
  * *Data stream input* – an unbounded sequence of events over time
  * *Reference data input* – static (or slowly changing) data used for lookups and correlation

* ASA and other Streaming Technologies
  * When to use Azure Stream Analytics
    * Recommended tool for analytics on Azure
    * Dashboards for data visualization
    * Real-time alerts from temporal and spatial patterns or anomalies
    * Basic Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) work
  * When to use other technologies
    * Apache Kafka connectivity (Azure Event Hubs are a good choice here)
    * In-line query handling in a language besides C# or JavaScript (e. g. Java; Spark Structured Streaming or specialized Azure Event Hubs implementation are good choices here)
    * Multi-cloud support (Azure Stream Analytics is Azure-specific; Spark Structured Streaming, Storm, etc. will work here)

* Why use Time Series Insights?
  * Time Series Insights gives a business the ability to examine historical data over long periods of time, including:
  * Discovery of data
  * Trending of data over time
  * Anomaly detection over time with basic machine learning
