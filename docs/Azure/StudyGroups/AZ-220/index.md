## What are study groups?

Community-based deep technical sessions with an emphasis on experiential learning.  Participants will be assigned homework that includes both reading and hands-on activities that are directly aligned to exam objectives.  The [Microsoft Tech Community "Learn IoT" Conversation Space](https://aka.ms/iottechcommunity/learniot) is available for study group students to ask questions so that your growth stays on track during this fast-paced learning environment. We'll also meet once a week to review key elements of the exam objectives.

## What are the requirements?

Prerequisites
* Software Development Experience
<br />- No specific software language required 
<br />- Does not need to be at a professional level
* Data Processing Experience
<br />- General understanding of data storage and data processing (recommended but not required)
* Cloud Solution Awareness
<br />- Have a basic understanding of PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS implementations
<br />- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) or equivalent skills, is recommended 

## What is in this repo?

Simple... Each file listed is a separate homework assignment, one for each of the exam objectives.
If you see a typo or want to add content that others may find useful, edit away and submit your changes!
Additionally, if you see something, say something!  Let's leverage the power of the community.

**If you run across an interesting blog post, article, nuggest of truth, update the documents on Github!**
